# Data scientist/researcher trained in Physics, Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience with extensive experience in applying analytical and machine learning techniques in healthcare and social science datasets

# Machine Learning applications in Health and Disease

1. Built an accurate prediction model of autism severity with ~26% explained variance compared to ~13% explained variance in previous models, using a combination of partial  least squares, support vector regression and elastic-net penalized linear regression in MATLAB (details in Moradi, Khundrakpam et al. NeuroImage 2017)  

2. Built a predictive model of cognition with ~37% explained variance compared to 16% explained variance in previous models, using random forest regression in MATLAB (details at https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.05.451172)  

3. Built a predictive model of chronological age with ~70% explained variance compared to 45% explained variance in previous models, using elastic net penalized linear regression model in MATLAB (details in Khundrakpam et al. NeuroImage 2015)

# Multivariate analysis of social environmental factors and brain 

1. Built multivariate models of social environmental factors and multi-modal brain data using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) of a large sample of population dataset (12,000 individuals comprising of social environmental and neuroimaging data) in MATLAB

# Complex systems modeling of social networks

1. As part of Complex Systems School organized by Santa Fe, performed a social network analysis of friendship networks (obtained via email and phones) and quantified social group evolution in MATLAB

2. Worked on the role of social environment and social clustering on epidemic spread using co-evolving network models
