Projects

Machine-learning based prediction of autism severity 

 Built a prediction model of autism severity using brain measurements from 81,924 locations covering the entire cortex 

 The model, implemented in MATLAB, combined partial  least squares regression with support vector regression and elastic-net penalized linear regression

 The model explained ~26% of the variance for autism severity, and this performance dropped to ~3% for simpler models
