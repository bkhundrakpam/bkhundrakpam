1. Built an accurate prediction model of autism severity with ~26% explained variance compared to ~13% explained variance in previous models, using a combination of partial  least squares, support vector regression and elastic-net penalized linear regression in MATLAB (details in Moradi, Khundrakpam et al. NeuroImage 2017)

2. Built a predictive model of cognition with ~37% explained variance compared to 16% explained variance in previous models, using random forest regression in MATLAB (details at https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.05.451172)  

3. Built a predictive model of chronological age with ~70% explained variance compared to 45% explained variance in previous models, using elastic net penalized linear regression model in MATLAB (details in Khundrakpam et al. NeuroImage 2015)

# Multivariate analysis of social environmental factors and brain 

1. Built multivariate models of social environmental factors and multi-modal brain data using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) of a large sample of population dataset (12,000 individuals comprising of social environmental and neuroimaging data) in MATLAB
